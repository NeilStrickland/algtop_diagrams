# algtop_diagrams

This is a set of interactive/animated/3D diagrams for an introductory course in Algebraic Topology.  

The diagrams have mostly been tested using Chrome on Windows with a 1920x1080 screen.  It would 
be good to improve the code so that they work reliably in more general settings.
